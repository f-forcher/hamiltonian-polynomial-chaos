# Master Thesis: Hamiltonian Polynomial Chaos
My ETH Zurich 2021 master thesis titled "Uncertainty quantification of
Hamiltonian maps using
intrusive polynomial chaos
expansion", on the application of intrusive Polynomial Chaos methods to stochastic equations in Hamiltonian mechanics, with application in particle accelerator simluations.

This repository contains the cleaned up, final version as delivered.
